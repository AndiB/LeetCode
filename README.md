# LeetCode
Code snippets from leetcode.com that I solved. 

Often on Leetcode people try to be clever and show off by writing code 
from scratch (especially with Python). 
Whenever feasible, I try to use existing functionality (as much as leetcode
allows it), as I don't want to rewrite code that is already in a library 
and tested and much more complete than anything I would write.
